[00:10.68] We were young, posters on the wall
[00:13.12] Praying we're the ones that the teacher wouldn't call
[00:16.16] We would stare at each other
[00:18.66] 'Cause we were always in trouble
[00:34.66] 
[00:21.01] And all the cool kids did their own thing
[00:24.05] I was on the outside always looking in
[00:26.85] Yeah, I was there but I wasn't
[00:29.23] They never really cared if I wasn't
[00:46.73] 
[00:32.58] We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
[00:38.44] Right when you need it the most
[00:42.69] We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
[00:48.92] A friend through the highs and the lows
[01:08.42] 
[00:53.14] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[00:58.68] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[01:33.18] 
[01:04.65] Then I saw your face, your forgivin' eyes
[01:07.63] Looking back at me from the other side
[01:10.63] Like you understood me
[01:13.49] And I'm never letting you go, oh
[01:29.49] 
[01:16.05] We all need that someone who gets you like no one else
[01:21.95] Right when you need it the most
[01:26.27] We all need a soul to rely on, a shoulder to cry on
[01:32.72] A friend through the highs and the lows
[01:52.22] 
[01:36.61] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[01:42.01] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[02:16.51] 
[01:47.54] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[01:53.16] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[02:27.66] 
[01:58.42] I'm not gonna make it alone
[02:01.42] (La, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone)
[02:03.93] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[02:38.43] 
[02:10.61] 'Cause you are that someone that gets me like no one else
[02:16.57] Right when I need it the most
[02:20.72] And I'll be the one you rely on, a shoulder to cry on
[02:27.13] A friend through the highs and the lows
[02:46.63] 
[02:31.14] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[02:36.58] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[03:11.08] 
[02:42.15] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[02:47.59] I'm not gonna make it a-la, la-la-la-la-la, la, la-la-la-la-la, 'lone
[02:53.14] I'm not gonna make it alone
